I am Clement (Cheuk Wai) Yung, a graduate student (PhD Mathematics) at the University of Toronto. I did my undergraduate studies at the National University of Singapore. I research on set theory and Ramsey theory under my supervisor Asst. Prof. Spencer Unger.

You can contact me at my email [clement.yung@mail.utoronto.ca](mailto:clement.yung@mail.utoronto.ca). I am rarely active on social media, but I enjoy hanging around Math StackExchange and MathOverflow (though I usually only ask questions on MathOverflow).

My favourite video game is [Super Smash Bros. Ultimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Ultimate). I am a proud main of Mr. Game and Watch. I used to join the locals in Singapore occasionally, but I have no intention of competing in the future. If you found a GnW online with a tag with a suspiciously close connection to what I've written in this site, you have probably found me.
