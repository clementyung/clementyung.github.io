I recently graduated from National University of Singapore with a Bachelor of Science (Hons) in Mathematics. I will be matriculating to University of Toronto in Fall 2022 as a graduate student (PhD Mathematics).

My interest revolves around set theory, infinitary combinatorics, topological Ramsey spaces and set theory's interactions with analysis. In particular, I like to explore how various results of analysis holds under different axiomatic systems. I wrote my Honours thesis under Asst. Prof. Spencer Unger (University of Toronto) and Prof. Yang Yue (National University of Singapore), titled "Diagonalisation Forcing of Infinite Block Sequences". 

I am currently a research assistant under Assoc. Prof. Dilip Raghavan. I am exploring on minimal counterexamples to Galvin's problem in higher dimensions.

You can contact me at my Gmail [yung.cwc@gmail.com](mailto:yung.cwc@gmail.com). I am rarely active on social medias, but I enjoy hanging around Math StackExchange and MathOverflow (though I usually only ask questions on MathOverflow).

My favourite video game is [Super Smash Bros. Ultimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Ultimate), and I join the locals from time to time. My current tag is **cy**. I am a proud main of Mr. Game and Watch.
