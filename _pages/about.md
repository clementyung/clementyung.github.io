I am currently a senior at National University of Singapore, and I will be matriculating to University of Toronto in Fall 2022 as a graduate student (PhD Mathematics).

My interest revolves around set theory and analysis. I like to explore how various results of analysis holds under different axiomatic systems. I wrote my Honours thesis under Asst. Prof. Spencer Unger (University of Toronto) and Prof. Yang Yue (National University of Singapore), titled "Diagonalisation Forcing of Infinite Block Sequences". A draft of my thesis can be found [here](https://clementyung.github.io/files/Honours_Thesis.pdf). Thanks to my supervisor, I also became interested in the theory of topological Ramsey spaces.

My favourite video game is [Super Smash Bros. Ultimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Ultimate), and I join the locals from time to time. My current tag is **cy**. I am a proud main of Mr. Game and Watch.
