I am organising (along with Brinda V., UofT) Student Set Theory and Combinatorics Seminar (SSTCS) for the academic year 2023-2024. SSTCS is a medium for graduate students to present and listen to talks given by their peers, focusing on set theory and combinatorics. You may find more details <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/student-set-theory-seminar" target="_blank">here</a>.

I'll also include abstract/talks given by me in this page, along with any materials I used during my talks.
