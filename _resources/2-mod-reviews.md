I wrote a review of almost every module I took as an undergraduate at National University of Singapore, and posted them on [NUSMods](nusmods.com). Here is a list of the modules I took and the links to their reviews.

If you are wondering why I did not take MA1101R Linear Algebra, MA1102R Calculus and ST1131 Introduction to Statistics, it is because I took the [advanced placement tests](https://www.science.nus.edu.sg/undergraduates/admissions/advanced-placement-credits/) for these three modules and passed. My grades for the tests were A-, B and C+ respectively, but the grades were not counted in the calculation of my overall CAP.
