I am Clement (Cheuk Wai) Yung, a graduate student (PhD Mathematics) at the University of Toronto. I did my undergraduate studies at the National University of Singapore. I am supervised by Asst. Prof. Spencer Unger.

You can contact me at my email [clement.yung@mail.utoronto.ca](mailto:clement.yung@mail.utoronto.ca). I am rarely active on social media, but I enjoy hanging around Math StackExchange and MathOverflow (though I usually only ask questions on MathOverflow).
