I am currently a senior at National University of Singapore, and I will be matriculating to University of Toronto in Fall 2022 as a graduate student (PhD Mathematics).

My interest revolves around set theory and analysis. I like to explore how various results of analysis holds under different axiomatic systems. I wrote my Honours thesis under Asst. Prof. Spencer Unger (University of Toronto) and Prof. Yang Yue (National University of Singapore), titled "Diagonalisation Forcing of Infinite Block Sequences". Thanks to my supervisor, I also became interested in the theory of topological Ramsey spaces.

You can contact me at my Gmail [yung.cwc@u.nus.edu](mailto:yung.cwc@u.nus.edu). I am rarely active on social medias, but I enjoy hanging around Math StackExchange and MathOverflow (though I usually only ask questions on MathOverflow).

My favourite video game is [Super Smash Bros. Ultimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Ultimate), and I join the locals from time to time. My current tag is **cy**. I am a proud main of Mr. Game and Watch.
