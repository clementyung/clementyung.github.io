title: "Readme - Suggested Solutions to Jech's <em>Set Theory</em>"
permalink: /jech-solutions/readme

I completed almost every exercise from Chapter 1 to Chapter 24, except 7.31, 15.11, 15.27, 16.4, 16.18, 19.12, 20.9, 20.20, and 24.10. Currently, I do not plan to do any further exercises.

While I try my best to do all the exercises myself, I do not take full credit for all the solutions. Several external sources that I frequently consulted include the [Math StackExchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/) network, the [MathOverflow](https://mathoverflow.net/) network, [a partial suggested solution manual written by Frederic Wang](https://frederic-wang.fr/mathematics/set-theory/jech/) (no longer available), and [notes written by J. D. Monk](http://euclid.colorado.edu/~monkd/jech.pdf). I also repeatedly referred to the books <em>The Higher Infinite</em> (2003) by Akihiro Kanamori, <em>Set Theory</em> (2011) by Kenneth Kunen, and occasionally <em>Combinatorial Set Theory: With a Gentle Introduction to Forcing</em> (2018) by Lorenz J. Halbeisen. For exercises related to Boolean algebras, I also referred to <em>Introduction to Boolean Algebras</em> (2009) by Steven Givant and Paul Halmos. Sometimes an exercise is adapted from a theorem proved in a paper cited in the <em>Historical Notes</em> section at the end of each chapter. I also referred to those papers if I was stuck and could not find help in the sources listed above.

I do not claim that my solutions are fully correct. I attempted these exercises to better understand the concepts in the same chapter, so I do not verify the correctness of most solutions here. There may be grammatical errors in my solution, as English is not my native language, and I was not meticulous in my writing. If you spot any errors or typos or have any queries in general, feel free to drop me an email at [clement.yung@mail.utoronto.ca](mailto:clement.yung@mail.utoronto.ca).
