### Time/Location
Wednesday 12pm-1pm (OI 8214)

### Content
Below is the list of problems I'll be covering each week. I aim to discuss 3-5 problems per week, or 1-2 problems if there is a quiz. The list is updated every Monday night (unless there is a quiz, in which case it is updated after the tutorial), and I try to update it on weekends when possible.
<ul>
   <li><strong>Week 3.</strong> Quiz (2.7.A, 2.4.C), 2.4.H, 2.6.A. </li>
   <li><strong>Week 4.</strong> 3.2.J, 3.2.P(f), 3.2.P(j), 3.2.P(m). </li>
   <li><strong>Week 5.</strong> Quiz (4.2.C(b), 3.2.P(i)), 4.3.B. </li>
   <li><strong>Week 6.</strong> <em>To be updated</em>. </li>
</ul>
