I am hosting a reading seminar in Summer 2023 in NUS. This reading seminar focuses on the intersection of set theory and recursion theory. We will meet every Friday 4-6pm from 12 May 2023 to 4 Aug 2023, except for the weeks of 12 Jun 2023 to 14 Jul 2023. The location has yet to be confirmed.

I will begin with the classical result that the Axiom of Determinacy, $\mathsf{AD}$, implies that $\aleph_1$ is a measurable cardinal, proven using Martin's cone theorem. I have not decided on the subsequent topics.

I will be uploading the notes I make here.
