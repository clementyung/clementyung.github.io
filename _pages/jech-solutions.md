I spent most of my summer break before the start of my PhD doing exercises in Jech's book. Here are my suggested solutions.

While I try my best to do all the exercises myself, I do not take full credit for all the solutions. Several external sources which I consult frequently include the <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/">Math StackExchange</a> network, the <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/">MathOverflow</a> network, <a href="https://frederic-wang.fr/mathematics/set-theory/jech/">a partial suggested solution manual written by Frederic Wang</a>, and <a href="http://euclid.colorado.edu/~monkd/jech.pdf">notes written by J. D. Monk</a>. I also repeatedly refer to the books <i>The Higher Infinite</i> (2003) by Akihiro Kanamori, <i>Set Theory</i> (2011) by Kenneth Kunen, and occasionally <i>Combinatorial Set Theory: With a Gentle Introduction to Forcing</i> (2018) by Lorenz J. Halbeisen. For exercises related to Boolean algebras, I also refer to <i>Introduction to Boolean Algebras</i> (2009) by Steven Giant and Paul Halmos. Sometimes, an exercise is adopted from a theorem proven in a cited paper in which Jech would include under the <i>Historical Notes</i> section at the end of each chapter. I would also refer to those papers if I'm stuck, and if I wasn't able to find help in the sources listed beforehand.

I do not claim that my solutions are fully correct. If you spot any errors or typos, or just have any queries in general, feel free to drop me a mail at <a href="mailto:clement.yung@mail.utoronto.ca">clement.yung@mail.utoronto.ca</a>.
