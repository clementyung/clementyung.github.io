I only started devoting myself to set theory at the second semester of my junior year, but thanks to various resources I was able to pick up the basics rather quickly. Here I list out some of the books I've used (and are still using), and my view on their content.

## <i>Set Theory</i>, Kenneth Kunen (2011)

This is the book I used when I first started learning set theory. 

This book excelled at conveying highly abstract set-theoretic concepts in a very intuitive way. There are many ways which set theory and topology are similar, and the book tries to remind the reader of such similiarities from time to time. If you are a fan of analysis and have a background in topology (like me back in junior year), I believe this book is for you.

Unfortunately this book uses a lot of nonstandard notations (e.g. $R(\alpha)$ instead of $V_\alpha$, $L(\alpha)$ instead of $L_\alpha$, $L(\alpha)[A]$ instead of $L_\alpha(A)$ etc.), so readers must be cautious of the truly standard notations when reading this book.

The exercises seem to either be too easy or difficult, and not much hints were provided.

I strongly recommend this book to people who wants to pick up set theory.


## <i>Set Theory</i>, Thomas Jech (2003)

This is the book that is always by my side nowadays.

This book is basically a set theory bible. Much of the theory in this book remains relevant nowadays. 

Most of the book is very detailed and well-written but the first 6 chapters are too brief for beginners to study with. I recommend beginners to start with Kunen (above), then this book for more advanced concepts. I tried to kickstart my self-study with this book but I eventually gave up. 

To nitpick, I dislike some minor inconsistencies in the notations used across the book (e.g. he always alternates between $\operatorname{cf}(\alpha)$ and $\operatorname{cf}{\alpha}$). However, they should not cause any serious misunderstandings.

This book has lots of exercises with good hints. They are also reasonably difficult and I recommend readers to attempt them as much as possible.


## <i>The Higher Infinite</i>, Akihiro Kanamori (2003)

This book is like Jech's book but focuses on large cardinals.

I don't read this book very often, but I feel that this book complements Jech's book very well (i.e. in parts where Jech's book is not clear, reading Kanamori's book usually clarifies my doubts).

Kanamori is extremely consistent with his notations in the book. If I ever were to write a book, I strive to write like Kanamori.

I only attempted a few exercises in this book.


## <i>Set Theory: An Introduction to Independence Proofs</i>, Kenneth Kunen (1980)

This is the predecessor of the Kunen's 2011 <i>Set Theory</i>. 

I don't have much to say about this book, but compared to the 2011 version I feel that this book introduces concepts in a very unmotivated manner. I found it very difficult to get through Chapter 3.

Contrary to the opinions of many logicians whom I've talked to, I feel that the 2011 version is better than this version.


## <i>Combinatorial Set Theory: With a Gentle Introduction to Forcing</i>, Lorenz J. Halbeisen (2018)

This is a very recent book on combinatorial set theory. It also serves as a bible, but (unsurprisingly) focuses on infinitary combinatorics.

I rarely read this book, but from what I see it provides a lot of subtle details/connections between concepts in infinitary combinatorics. It is also much more updated due to its recency. Thus, this is the first book I look at if I can't find the details I want in Jech, Kunen and Kanamori.

I strongly do not recommend starting on set theory, or just self-studying in general, with this book (yes I tried).
