# Student Set Theory and Combinatorics Seminar at University of Toronto

I am organising (along with Brinda V., UofT) Student Set Theory and Combinatorics Seminar (SSTCS) for the academic year 2023-2024. SSTCS is a medium for graduate students to present and listen to talks given by their peers, focusing on set theory and combinatorics.
