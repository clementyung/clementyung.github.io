I organised the Student Set Theory and Combinatorics Seminar (SSTCS) from Sep 2023 to Apr 2025, together with Brinda V. at the University of Toronto. SSTCS provides a platform for graduate students to present and attend talks by their peers on topics in set theory and combinatorics. The list of talks given can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iLanndI0f6N4-kQPJ8UF86NI6BQm_CQyuxQL2xP2GxE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.
